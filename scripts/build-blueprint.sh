# Rebuild every view of the blueprint, in dependency order, from one command.
#
# There are three views of the same source, and nothing in the framework rebuilds them
# together -- the shared docs workflow builds the PDFs only, and the plasTeX web build is
# still listed as future work in article-kit's LINKAGE.md ("activate the full leanblueprint
# web/dep-graph build"). So this script is the local answer: run it at each round boundary
# and the three cannot drift apart.
#
#   check     `linkage check`           the gate -- statuses, ledger refs, \uses closure,
#                                       and the clean-render rule. Runs FIRST and stops the
#                                       build, because a render-breaking node should fail
#                                       here rather than silently lose a command downstream.
#   print     blueprint/src/print.pdf   statements and proofs as typeset mathematics
#   web       blueprint/web/            the same PLUS the dependency graph and [T]/[A] tags
#   manifest  .manifest-preview.json    what the hub would transclude (pandoc-rendered)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-blueprint.sh              everything (~30s)
#   scripts/build-blueprint.sh --quick      skip the web build (~13s) -- the inner loop
#   scripts/build-blueprint.sh --web        the web build only
#   scripts/build-blueprint.sh --serve      everything, then serve the graph on :8000
#
# The dependency graph needs a server: file:// URLs cannot fetch the graph's JSON.
