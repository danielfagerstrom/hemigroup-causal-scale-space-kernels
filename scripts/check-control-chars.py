"""Reject stray control characters in source files.

Why this exists: writing LaTeX or Lean through a non-raw Python string literal silently turns
`\\begin` into U+0008, `\\texttt` into a TAB and `\\ref` into a CR. The result still looks almost
right in a diff, and LaTeX fails several hundred lines later with a message that names the
character rather than the cause. This ran three times in one session before being caught.

Legal control characters in these sources are LF and (on Windows checkouts) CR immediately before
LF. Anything else -- a bare TAB, a lone CR, a backspace -- is corruption.

Usage: python scripts/check-control-chars.py [paths...]   (default: the tracked source trees)
