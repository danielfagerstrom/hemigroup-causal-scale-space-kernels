# The target types of chapter 11 — **all discharged**

`thm:signaling-form` is Theorem 4′, and by the author's account the formulation the article exists
for. This file holds chapter 11's target types while they are being proved. **Nothing is left in
it**, which is the outcome the statement-first convention exists to reach.

## What moved, and when

| node | declaration | file (under `Hemigroup/`) |
|---|---|---|
| `lem:mellin-data` (11.2) | `mellin_profile`, `norm_mellin_profile_le` | `MellinData.lean` |
| `lem:inversion-symbol` (11.14) | `meromorphicOn_inversionSymbol` + 5 | `InversionSymbol.lean` |
| `lem:symbol-rigidity` (11.15) | `SameSymbolAction.eventuallyEq` | `SymbolUniqueness.lean` |
| `lem:mellin-vertical` (11.13) | `verticalIntegrable_mellin_profile` | `MellinVertical.lean` |
| `lem:inversion-operator-action` (11.16) | `inversionOperator` + 3 | `InversionOperator.lean` |

All of it reduces to ledger **A17** and nothing else.

## Two of them are worth reading about

`lem:mellin-vertical` was recorded, twice, as blocked on Mathlib: the bound of `lem:mellin-data`
reduces vertical integrability to the decay of `|Γ(c+iτ)|`, and Mathlib has no such estimate —
`Stirling.lean` is Stirling's formula for `n !` alone. That was true about Mathlib and false about
the obligation. The classical asymptotic `|Γ(c+iτ)| ∼ √(2π)|τ|^{c-1/2}e^{-π|τ|/2}` does need
Stirling in the complex plane; **integrability needs only quadratic decay**, and quadratic decay is
two lines of the functional equation. See `Hemigroup/MellinVertical.lean`.

`lem:inversion-operator-action` is the split that writing `def:inversion-operator` in Lean forced.
The blueprint's definition sets `(A g)(x)` to a contour integral and glosses it as `x⁻¹(B(θ)g)(x)`,
the gloss being what ledger A12 licenses. Formalising it separates the two: the operator is total
and needs no hypothesis at all, while the gloss needs a *referent* for `B(θ)g` — the function `h`
with `h̃ = B(-z)g̃(z)` on the line. Given that `h`, everything is interface-free. So 11.16 is [T],
`def:inversion-operator` keeps A12, and what A12 now carries is exactly the production of `h`.
See `Hemigroup/InversionOperator.lean` for the second finding, about which equality the identity
on the line can be asked for.
